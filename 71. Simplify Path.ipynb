    "A single period '.' represents the current directory.\n",
    "A double period '..' represents the previous/parent directory.\n",
    "Multiple consecutive slashes such as '//' and '///' are treated as a single slash '/'.\n",
    "Any sequence of periods that does not match the rules above should be treated as a valid directory or file name. For example, '...' and '....' are valid directory or file names.\n",
    "The simplified canonical path should follow these rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "The path must start with a single slash '/'.\n",
    "Directories within the path must be separated by exactly one slash '/'.\n",
